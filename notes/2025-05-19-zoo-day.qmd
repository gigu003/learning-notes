## Reading

Last Saturday, Emily and her classmates went on a school trip to the city zoo. It was a warm and sunny day, perfect for walking around and seeing the animals. Everyone was excited because it was their first time visiting the zoo together.

When they arrived, their teacher gave them a map and explained the plan for the day. First, they visited the monkey area. The monkeys were very active — they jumped from tree to tree and made funny noises. Emily laughed when one monkey tried to steal a visitor’s hat!

Next, they went to see the lions and tigers. The lions were sleeping under a big tree, but the tigers were walking around their cage. One tiger came very close to the glass, and some students were a little scared.

At lunchtime, the class sat in a **picnic area** and shared their food. After that, they visited the giraffes and elephants. Emily was surprised to learn that giraffes sleep for only 30 minutes a day!

Before leaving, they went to the zoo shop. Emily bought a **keychain** with a panda on it. She said it was one of the best school trips she ever had.
