## Reading

Ring-tailed lemurs are interesting animals that live only in **Madagascar**. They have long tails with black and white rings, which helps them balance when jumping between trees. These lemurs spend about 40% of their time on the ground, unlike most other lemur species.

An adult ring-tailed lemur weighs about 2-3 kilograms. They have **gray fur** with white faces, and their eyes are surrounded by black patches. Their tails are longer than their bodies, measuring up to 60 centimeters. Groups of lemurs, called troops, usually contain 15-20 members led by females.

These animals communicate using sounds and smells. They make different calls to warn about danger or keep the group together. Male lemurs rub **scent glands** on their wrists to mark **territory**. During cold mornings, they often sit with their arms open to **warm up** in the sun.

Ring-tailed lemurs eat mainly fruits, leaves, and flowers. Sometimes they eat **insects** or small animals. They search for food during daytime and sleep in trees at night. Baby lemurs stay with their mothers for about six months before becoming **independent**.

Sadly, ring-tailed lemurs are **endangered** due to **forest loss** and hunting. Many organizations work to **protect their habitats**. Visitors to Madagascar can see them in national parks, but must keep distance to avoid **disturbing** them.

These special creatures teach us about **nature's diversity**. By protecting lemurs, we help keep Madagascar's environment healthy for future generations.
